name: Orchestrate
description: Orchestrate provides a simple RESTful API service that eliminates the
  need for developers to operate their own databases in production. Powered by best-of-breed
  NoSQL databases, it unifies full-text search, social graph, activity feed, key/value
  document and time-ordered event queries in a single interface, eliminating the operational
  and financial burden of deploying databases when both building new applications
  and adding new features to existing ones.
